# Headstarter-Codebase-RAG

**Headstarter-Codebase-RAG** is a project designed to create an AI expert for codebases using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The goal is to enable intuitive interactions with codebases, allowing users to understand their structure, functionality, and potential areas for improvement.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered assistant capable of retrieving and analyzing relevant sections of a codebase to answer user queries. The process involves embedding the codebase, storing embeddings in a vector database (Pinecone), and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses.

The `/ai-coding-agent-help` command on Slack illustrates this functionality: when a query is provided, the tool retrieves the most relevant code snippets and uses an LLM to craft a helpful response.

## Key Features

- **Codebase Embedding:** Converts codebase contents into vector representations.
- **Vector Database Storage:** Uses Pinecone to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
- **LLM Integration:** Generates intelligent, context-aware responses based on the codebase content.
- **Web Application Interface:** Interact with the AI expert through a user-friendly web app.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn to:

1. Embed codebase contents into vector formats.
2. Use Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval.
3. Implement RAG workflows to enable intelligent codebase interaction.
4. Build a web application to chat with the AI expert.

## Submission Requirement

The final deliverable is a functional web application where users can chat with a codebase.

## Development Options

You can choose one of the following approaches to build the web app:

1. **Using Python (Streamlit):**  
   Refer to the [Streamlit documentation](https://streamlit.io) for guidance on building a chatbot.

2. **Using React and Next.js:**  
   Explore the [AI Chatbot template on Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates) for a React-based implementation.
